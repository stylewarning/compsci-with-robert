## git cheatsheet

git init                 # initializes a new repo
git clone <url>          # clones/copies a repo from the internet

git add <file>           # stages <file> for committing
git commit -m "message"  # commit staged changes with the message

git log                  # looks at the log of commits
git diff                 # look at the current unstaged changes

git push origin master   # push your changes to origin/master
git pull origin master   # pull the latest changes
git pull --rebase origin master
                         # pull changes and re-apply my changes on top
